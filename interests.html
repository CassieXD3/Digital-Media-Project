  <h1>My moodboard based projects </h1>
<P>I am in the middle of writing my own story as an author so for the moodboard project, I based it off of my two stars of the book. I am very connected to their magical journey so far, so this project as well as the logo I made for them during the Logo workshop, on the side, are very close to my heart. <3</P>
